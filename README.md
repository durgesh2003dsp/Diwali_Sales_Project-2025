# Diwali_Sales_Project-2025
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Diwali sales data using Python. The objective is to analyze customer purchasing behavior, identify high-performing segments, and generate actionable business insights that can help improve sales and marketing strategies.


## **Dataset Description**

The dataset contains customer and transaction-level information related to Diwali sales, including:

Customer Gender

Age Group

Marital Status

State

Occupation

Product Category

Product ID

Order Count

Purchase Amount

The data required cleaning and preprocessing before analysis.

## Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning & manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis & reporting

## Project Workflow
**1] Data Import & Understanding**

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Checked shape, columns, and data types

Identified missing and incorrect values


**2] Data Cleaning**

Removed null values

Converted data types where required

Renamed columns for better readability

Removed unnecessary columns


**3] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Performed analysis using groupby, aggregation, and sorting to answer business questions such as:

Which gender contributes more to total sales?

Which age group spends the most?

Top-performing states by total purchase amount

Occupation-wise and product category-wise sales analysis

Identification of top-selling products


**4] Data Visualization**

Bar charts and count plots for better insights

Sales comparison across demographics

Clear and readable visual storytelling


## Key Insights

Female customers contributed higher purchase value compared to males

Age group 26–35 showed the highest purchasing power
